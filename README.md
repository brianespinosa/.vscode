Shared VSCode settings

These [settings](https://github.com/brianespinosa/.vscode) can be copied as a starting point, or included as a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) in another project.

> Very heavily javascript/typescript/css/html focused. I would not recommend others include my settings in their own projects directly. But feel free to fork this project and then customize your shared settings to your own liking.
